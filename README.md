# awakens-shell

This uses the chat website "https://awakens.me/" to grab all the JS Files needed to do stuff like open and close the menu, go throughout the menu, etc.

What this isn't:

A full-fledged chat client: It literally does nothing.

Useful: This is done merely to show off the UI and the animations.

What this is:

*Possibly* a good way to work with CSS and HTML. (and maybe more, Idk.)


That's about it. Oh and also, the Awakens chat source code was moved to a private repository, but a relatively recent version is avaliable
at https://github.com/YOURsammich/OldAwakens

Idk anymore.
